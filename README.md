Fauxbar-API
===========

Fauxbar is a Chrome browser extension that provides vastly improved URL completion / suggestion compared to the built-in omnibox. In order to make these suggestions available for use by other extensions that use non-standard URL input elements (e.g. Vimium), I refactored the code a bit to provide a barebones API to Fauxbar's functionality.
